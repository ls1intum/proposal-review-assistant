# How to Scientific Writing

## Best practices

 **![warning](/plugins/servlet/twitterEmojiRedirector?id=26a0 "warning") Please follow these best practices when writing your scientific work (dissertation, paper, thesis, proposal, etc.) ![warning](/plugins/servlet/twitterEmojiRedirector?id=26a0 "warning")** 

### **1. General Writing Style**

*   Use the provided templates (see below)
*   Avoid “As discussed before” or similar phrases.
*   Limit the use of filler words such as “additional,” “furthermore,” “moreover,” and “also”; only use them when necessary.
*   Use clear and direct language to articulate your arguments and findings, avoiding unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. Avoid writing in a German essay style. Use concise, simple, and academic sentences without excessive elaboration.
    
*   Do not start sentences with “As…”, “Since…”, “To…”, “In order to…”, or “Because…”.
*   **Use active formulations, avoid passive voice, “one,” “I,” and “our.”** Use “we” sparingly, only when referring to the thesis’ approach.
*   **Identify actors and powerful subjects and formulate all your sentences in active voice!**
*   Ensure consistency in terminology and phrasing, especially when referring to key concepts, models, or theories. Repetitions are encouraged for consistency; avoid synonyms that might confuse readers.
    
*   Avoid strong statements and superlatives (e.g., “very”, “wide”, “optimal”).
*   Avoid filler words (e.g., “actually”, “clearly”, “obviously”).
*   Do not excessively use abbreviations, because readers might not be familiar with them. Maintain a list of abbreviations.
*   Avoid contractions (e.g., use “do not” instead of “don’t” and “it is” instead of “it’s”).
    
*   Avoid jargon or highly technical terms unless necessary, and provide clear definitions when using specialized terms.
    

### **2\. Paragraphs and Section Structure**

*   Ensure that each section introduces and concludes with a clear point to maintain a logical flow of ideas
*   Use subheadings to break up long sections, improving readability and making it easier for the reader to follow the structure.
*   Avoid too detailed subsection structures / outlines, i.e. use at most three digits. E.g. 3.1.4 is ok, but 3.1.4.1 is too much!
*   Every chapter/section needs to include text, even Section 1 before Section 1.1.
*   Avoid overly short sections or paragraphs that disrupt the flow; combine them with adjacent sections if necessary, i.e. every chapter/section should be at least two paragraphs long, ideally half a page; otherwise, consider making it a paragraph.
*   Paragraphs should have a balanced length, approximately 5-10 lines.
*   Ensure a smooth transition between sections and paragraphs by linking ideas coherently to maintain continuity
*   Write the text mainly in regular paragraphs, not in bullet points.
*   Keep bullet points and lists to a maximum of 1-2 lines.

### **3\. Bibliography and References**

*   Ensure that all cited sources are relevant and contribute meaningfully to your argument or background.
    
*   Use a consistent citation style throughout the thesis (ideally **alpha** with \[ABC12\]).
    
*   Only include peer-reviewed conference papers or journal articles in your bibliography.
*   Avoid including internet sources in the literature; if used at all, include them as footnotes.
*   Clean up your bibliography to avoid duplicate or incorrect information (e.g., location details for ACM conferences).
*   Avoid simply copying and pasting Google Scholar entries; manual cleanup is often required.
*   The citation should be placed before the full stop (e.g., some example text \[AB12\].) and **not** after the full stop.
*   Regularly cross-check in-text citations with the bibliography to ensure all sources are listed and correctly referenced.
    
*   If citing textbooks or technical reports, ensure they are authoritative and well-established within the field.
    

### **4\. Figures, Diagrams, and Tables**

*   Include many figures and tables to enhance readability.
*   Avoid short, generic, and meaningless captions; instead, use long, informative captions.
*   Avoid using sequence diagrams; instead, consider using activity or communication diagrams.
*   **Use light mode for tool screenshots on white paper** (dark mode does not look good and wastes ink in case someone still prints the work)
*   Ensure that every figure and table is referenced in the text and explained in detail.
*   **Ensure that all figures and tables are readable when you open the PDF in 100%.**
*   **Use vector graphics (SVG, PDF) whenever possible to improve figure readability and decrease PDF size.**
*   Use high-quality images, diagrams, and tables to ensure clarity, especially when conveying complex information.
*   Make sure to use consistent keys (legends) in all figures throughout the work and always label x and y axis accordingly.
*   Keep figures and diagrams as simple as possible, avoiding excessive detail that could overwhelm the reader.
*   Ensure that figures and tables are placed close to where they are first referenced in the text for better readability.
*   Use consistent styles and formats for all figures, diagrams, and tables throughout the thesis to maintain a professional and cohesive appearance.
*   Ensure that tables are used to present structured, comparable data, and not as a substitute for narrative text.

### **5\. Tools for Writing Assistance**

*   Utilize Grammarly, DeepL, and ChatGPT for writing assistance to avoid spelling and grammar mistakes.
*   When using AI tools, ensure ethical usage by reviewing all AI-generated content and adapting it to your own style and argumentation
    
*   In particular, follow [AI Transparency](/spaces/EduResStud/pages/212046923/AI+Transparency), carefully review the created text and mention this in the transparency statement. 
*   Use reference management tools like Zotero, EndNote, or Mendeley to efficiently organize and format citations and references.
    
*   Regularly back up your work (e.g. using git or cloud storage services such Dropbox to avoid data loss)
    

### 6\. **Author’s Work and Related Work**

*   Provide a **clear distinction** between the related work and the author’s own work.
*   Clearly define the scope of related work and focus on studies directly relevant to your thesis.
*   Critically analyze related work, highlighting gaps, limitations, or differences from your own work.
*   Group related works based on themes or approaches to make comparisons more meaningful.
*   Ensure that related work covers both seminal papers and the latest research to demonstrate awareness of the field’s evolution.
*   Avoid overloading the reader with excessive details from the related work; focus on summarizing the key points.
*   Clearly state how your work builds upon, differs from, or extends the related work.
*   Use citations effectively to support claims made in your comparison of related work.

## First steps on writing your thesis

1.  First create an outline for all the chapters and add some bullet-points/subsections on the content you want to write and send it to your advisor
2.  Next, create models for your thesis
    1.  Those can be use case models, analysis object model, dynamic model, subsystem decomposition, hardware software mapping, object diagram etc.
    2.  Keep 7+-2 elements in the diagram
    3.  Only show the parts of the Artemis that you changed
3.  Start with writing the requirements analysis and system design chapter
4.  Keep in mind: You are responsible for your thesis and send chapters to your advisor to get feedback
