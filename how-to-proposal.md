# How to Proposal  

Before you start your thesis, you have to hand in a proposal. This proposal describes the problem you want to solve, the motivation why this problem should be solved, the objectives you want to achieve and a preliminary schedule for the thesis. 

Your proposal should be a high-level overview, enriched with details where necessary. The proposal should be around 5-7 pages long. Try to be as concise as possible. Think of the proposal as a elevator pitch to someone who is not not new to the technical details but never heard of the problem / idea you want to tackle in your theses. 

Make sure to enrich your proposal with figures and UML diagrams. Use the type of diagram you find most appropriate for your topic. (Important: Keep it high-level! - Describe the problem!). You should have at least 2 diagrams/mockups!

You have to back your claims with scientific sources. Make sure to cite at least 6-8 publications to show you already invested time and effort to understand the topic thoroughly. 

  

Please use our Proposal and Theses Template from github: [https://github.com/ls1intum/thesis-template-typst](https://github.com/ls1intum/thesis-template-typst)

## Proposal Structure

  

      Abstract 

*   *   Short (1/3-1/2 page) summary of the project 
    *   It is fine to repeat yourself here 

1.  Introduction 
    *   Introduce the reader to the general setting (No Problem description yet)
    *   What is the environment?
    *   What are the tools in use?
    *   **Less than one page**
2.  Problem 
    *   What is/are the problem(s)? 
    *   Identify the actors and use these to describe how the problem negatively influences them.
    *   Do not present solutions or alternatives yet!
    *   Present the negative consequences in detail 
3.  Motivation 
    *   Outline why it is (scientifically) important to solve the problem
    *   Again use the actors to present your solution, but don't be to specific
    *   Do not repeat the problem, instead focus on the positive aspects when the solution to the problem is available
    *   Be visionary! 
    *   Optional: motivate with existing research, previous work 
4.  Objective
    *   What are the main goals of your thesis? 
    *   Ideally this section starts with a short overview where you state the goals with short enumerated bulletpoints, i.e. 1., 2., 3., ...
    *   Then, the section has a sub section for each goal (repeating the bulletpoint before to stay consistent) which is at least two paragraphs long and describes the goal in more detail
5.  Schedule 

*   *   When will the thesis Start 
    *   Create a rough plan for your thesis (separate the time in iterations with a length of 2-4 weeks)
    *   Each iteration should contain several smaller work items - Again keep it high-level and make to keep your plan realistic
    *   Make sure the work-items are measurable and deliverable, they should describe features that are vertically integrated
    *   Do **not** include thesis writing or presentation tasks
    *   Ensure to follow agile principles: You must not have an iteration to collect requirements. Instead, in an agile environment, you have a backlog and then you would select backlog items in each sprint and plan them during the sprint
        *   Therefore, focus on the features that you want to develop and reference the high level goals from chapter 4.

Bibliography

*   Must only contain scientific and peer-reviewed publications (conference papers, journal articles, scientific books). Everything else should be a footote.

Transparency statement

*   If you used AI, add a transparency statement that you used ChatGPT for this proposal, for example. Ensure to be specific and not just use a template!

  

**General hints**

*   A good proposal includes two figures with a descriptive, extensive figure captions and references those figures in the text (e.g. Figure 1 shows ...)
*   At least one figure must be a suitable UML diagram, the second one can be a screenshot, chart, picture or another UML diagram
*   The proposal should **not** be longer than 5-7 pages
*   Stay consistent in your proposal!
*   Split longer blocks of text into multiple parapraphs
    *   Paragraphs should be between 5 and 10 lines
*   If you use screenshots, **always** use light mode screenshots
