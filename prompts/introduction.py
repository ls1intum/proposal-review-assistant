INTRODUCTION_PROMPT = """
Evaluate my thesis proposal introduction and provide feedback on the following aspects:

1. Length: Is it appropriately sized (less than one page, approximately 300 words)?

2. Focus: Does it introduce the general setting without prematurely describing the problem or solution?

3. Context: Does it effectively establish the environment and tools in use without diving into solutions?

4. Background: Does it provide sufficient context for understanding the problem that will be described in the next section?

5. Clarity: Is it written clearly with appropriate citations to support contextual statements?

6. Structure: Does it lead logically into the problem section with a smooth transition?

7. Active voice: Is it written predominantly in active voice with clear identification of actors?

8. Citations: Are facts or claims properly supported by citations to scientific literature placed before periods?

The introduction should set the stage for the proposal without jumping ahead to problem statements or solution discussions. It should be concise yet informative, providing readers with the necessary background to understand the significance of the research.
